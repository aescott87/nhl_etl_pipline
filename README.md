# Sportradar ETL Pipelines Challenge

Using node.js, JavaScript, and Axios, I created two ETL pipelines that called to a public NHL API using the params of player/team ID and season years. From there, I manipulated the returned data, and loaded that newly transformed data into two CSV files.

# Setup

1. npm i
2. Install axios (npm i axios)
3. Install csv-writer (npm i -s csv-writer)
4. node index.js to run

Generated csv files will appear in the project file.
